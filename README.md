# Hi, I'm Rob 👋

I'm a Senior Site Reliability Engineer building tools that reduce operational toil and make reliability easier for everyone.

## 🔧 Creator of NthLayer
**NthLayer** is an open-source project that turns a simple service definition into production-ready dashboards, alerts, SLOs, and recording rules — all from a single YAML file.

It’s a declarative “Operations-as-Code” engine designed to:
- Standardize observability across teams
- Eliminate repetitive dashboard/alert setup  
- Bake SRE best practices into every service by default  
- Give teams a reliable, Git-first workflow for operational readiness

## 🔭 What I'm Working On
- Expanding NthLayer’s support for more tech stacks  
- Improving automated PromQL linting and rule generation  
- Experimenting with metrics discovery and adaptive alerting  
- Exploring the future of AI-assisted reliability engineering  

## 📫 Connect
If you're working on SRE, DevOps, platform engineering, or observability tooling, I’d love to collaborate or hear your thoughts.

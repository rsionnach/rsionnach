## ⚡ What I’m Building: NthLayer

**NthLayer** is an open-source **Operations-as-Code engine** that generates the entire observability and reliability stack from a single YAML file.

It produces:

- 📊 Grafana dashboards  
- 🔔 Prometheus alerting rules  
- 🎯 SLOs & recording rules  
- 🧭 Service metadata & runbooks  
- 🧪 Validated PromQL expressions  

It removes the repetitive operational glue engineers rebuild for every new service, and brings consistency to platform teams through a declarative model.

👉 **Repo:** https://github.com/rsionnach/nthlayer

## 🧠 Why I Built It

As an SRE, I’ve seen the same problems repeat across teams:

- Every new service starts with no dashboards  
- Alerts are inconsistent or missing  
- SLOs are rarely defined early (or correctly)  
- Observability onboarding is slow and manually-driven  
- Tribal knowledge dictates reliability practices

NthLayer emerged from one belief:

> **Operational readiness should be declarative, repeatable, and automated — not hand-built every time.**

## 🔭 Current Work & Focus

- Expanding NthLayer tech stack templates (Redis, MySQL, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Improving PromQL linting + safety validation  
- Researching metric discovery patterns  
- Polishing the CLI workflow (`nthlayer plan/apply`)  
- Experimenting with AI-assisted SLO recommendations and alert tuning
